## Day 1 - Project Selection: 

**GOAL:** Determine and choose a full stack project to work on.

On the first day of the _75 Code_ challenge, your objective is to select a full stack project to undertake throughout the duration of the challenge. A full stack project refers to a development project that involves working on both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) components of a web application.

When selecting a project, consider the following factors:

1. **Interest:** Choose a project that aligns with your interests and passions. Working on something you find engaging and exciting will help you stay motivated throughout the challenge.
2. **Scope:** Determine the scale and complexity of the project. Ensure that it is feasible to complete within the 75-day timeframe. It's better to choose a project that challenges you but is still achievable.
3. **Learning Opportunities:** Select a project that allows you to explore new technologies, frameworks, or programming languages. This will provide valuable learning experiences and help you expand your skill set.
4. **Impact:** Consider the potential impact of the project. Whether it's solving a problem, addressing a need, or creating value, choose a project that can make a meaningful impact in some way.

Take the time to research and brainstorm project ideas that meet these criteria. Once you have identified a suitable full stack project, make the final decision and move forward with enthusiasm and determination. Remember, this project will be the focus of your efforts for the next 75 days, so choose wisely and embrace the challenge ahead!

## Days 2 - 73: The 72-Day Push

During the 72-Day Push phase, we will establish the following daily habits:

1. **Minimum of Ten Minutes of Planning:** Dedicate at least ten minutes each day to planning your tasks and objectives. This will help you stay organized and focused on your goals.
2. **Daily Problem-Solving:** Engage in problem-solving activities every day. Challenge yourself with problems that require critical thinking and may be outside your usual scope. This practice will enhance your problem-solving skills and broaden your perspective.
3. **One Hour of Project Work:** Allocate at least one hour every day to work on your chosen project. This dedicated time will allow you to make consistent progress towards your long-term goals and ensure the completion of your project within the 75-day period.
4. **Thirty Minutes of Technical Reading:** Spend at least thirty minutes each day reading about a technical topic that goes beyond traditional programming concepts. Focus on subjects related to security or operations, such as Docker, Kubernetes, terminal usage, or Git. This dedicated reading time will help you sharpen your skills and deepen your understanding of essential tools and technologies.
