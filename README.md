# 75 Code - Obsidian Notebook Template

I created the 75 Code challenge after starting the 75 Hard challenge and having a friend ask "can you help me build discipline around learning to program," so here it is!
The 75 Code challenge draws inspiration from the 75 Hard challenge and aims to enhance your programming skills and discipline over a period of 75 days.

## Getting Started

If you don't want to use this structure but still want to attempt the challenge, the overview can be found [here](https://github.com/Tirithel/75-code/blob/main/75%20Code%20Challenge%20Overview.md).

### Requirements:

### Steps:

1. Click "Use This Template."
2. Create a new repository.
3. Clone the repository you created.
4. In Obsidian `File` -> `Open Vault...` -> `Open Folder as Vault`
5. Begin the challenge!

## Contributing

This was just something I threw together one night, feel free to contribute, I pay attention to notifications and am happy to 1) address issues and 2) approve PRs. Ideally I'd like to not include too many additional community plugins so we can keep this light weight.
