# 75 Code - Obsidian Notebook Template

The 75 Code challenge was inspired by my participation in the 75 Hard challenge and a friend's request for help in developing programming discipline. Thus, I present to you the 75 Code challenge! This challenge draws inspiration from 75 Hard and aims to improve your programming skills and discipline over a period of 75 days.

In this challenge, we will:

- See a project through from beginning to end.
- Challenge ourselves by tackling coding interview questions daily.
- Improve our knowledge in a programming-related subject.
- Cultivate the habit of daily technical reading.

## Contributing

This template was created on a whim, so feel free to contribute! I'm actively monitoring notifications and willing to 1) address any issues and 2) approve pull requests. Ideally, I would prefer to keep this template lightweight by avoiding the inclusion of too many additional community plugins.
